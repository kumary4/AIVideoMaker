# Kling AI Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

This AI video generation platform is designed to work with Kling AI's API for professional video creation. The system includes both simulation mode (for development/testing) and production mode with actual Kling AI integration.

## Current Status

âœ… **Simulation Mode Active** - The platform currently runs in simulation mode, generating mock video results for testing
ðŸ”§ **Production Ready** - All infrastructure is in place to connect to real Kling AI API

## Setting Up Kling AI API

### 1. Get Kling AI API Credentials

1. Visit [Kling AI Developer Portal](https://platform.kling.ai)
2. Create an account and verify your email
3. Navigate to API section and generate your API key
4. Note your API endpoint (usually `https://api.kling.ai/v1`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add these secrets to your Replit project:

```bash
KLING_AI_API_KEY=your_kling_ai_api_key_here
KLING_AI_BASE_URL=https://api.kling.ai/v1
```

### 3. API Integration Features

The platform supports:
- âœ… Text-to-video generation with custom prompts
- âœ… Multiple video styles (cinematic, documentary, animation, etc.)
- âœ… Various aspect ratios (16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3)
- âœ… Duration control (15 seconds to 3 minutes)
- âœ… Automatic status polling and completion detection
- âœ… Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## How It Works

### 1. Video Generation Flow

```
User Prompt â†’ Kling AI API â†’ Processing â†’ Polling â†’ Completion â†’ Storage
```

### 2. Implementation Details

- **Async Processing**: Videos are generated asynchronously with status polling
- **Timeout Handling**: 5-minute maximum processing time
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback to simulation if API fails
- **Credit System**: Users consume credits based on video duration

### 3. Simulation vs Production

**Simulation Mode (Current)**:
- Instant mock video generation
- No API costs
- Perfect for development and testing
- Shows complete user flow

**Production Mode (With API Key)**:
- Real Kling AI video generation
- Actual processing time (30 seconds - 5 minutes)
- High-quality AI-generated videos
- Usage-based billing through Kling AI

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Simulation Mode Testing
1. Create an account on the platform
2. Try generating a video with any prompt
3. Check dashboard for status updates
4. Videos will complete in ~10 seconds (simulated)

### 2. Production Mode Testing
1. Add your Kling AI API credentials to Replit Secrets
2. Restart the application
3. Generate a video - it will use real Kling AI API
4. Processing time will be realistic (30s - 5min)

## Monitoring and Logs

- Check application logs for Kling AI API responses
- Monitor credit usage in user dashboard
- Track video generation success/failure rates
- API usage statistics available in Kling AI dashboard

## Costs and Credits

### Platform Credits
- 1 credit = 30 seconds of video
- Free tier: 5 credits (2.5 minutes of video)
- Paid tiers: 50-1000+ credits

### Kling AI API Costs
- Charges apply when using real API
- Typically $0.10-0.50 per video depending on duration/quality
- Monitor usage in Kling AI dashboard

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Not authenticated" errors**: Users need to sign up first
2. **"Insufficient credits"**: Users need to upgrade or wait for credit refresh
3. **Generation timeout**: Videos taking longer than 5 minutes are marked as failed
4. **API errors**: System automatically falls back to simulation mode

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=kling-ai:*
```

This provides detailed API interaction logs for troubleshooting.
